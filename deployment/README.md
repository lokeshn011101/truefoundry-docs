# Overview

TrueFoundry lets you deploy your machine learning models as services with minimal effort. This deployment comes with best practices like monitoring, auto-scaling, versioning & reproducibility out of the box.

[`servicefoundry`](https://pypi.org/project/servicefoundry/) is the client-side library from TrueFoundry used to deploy services. It is available both as a command line interface (CLI) and a Python module that you can use to deploy models directly from training notebooks like Jupyter.
