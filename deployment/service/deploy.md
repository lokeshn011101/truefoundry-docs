# Deploy a Service

You can deploy services on Truefoundry using our Python SDK, or via a YAML file or using our UI. 

Let's consider the service code we wrote in the [previous section](./definition.md). For deploying we will need the workspace FQN 
which you can copy from the workspaces page ([detailed guide here](../faq/get-workspace-fqn.md))

// TODO: Write the YAML and Python code to deploy the service
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Deploying using python API" %}


## Build Section

// TODO: We should have a page to explain the Build part and refer to it from here.
